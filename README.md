## Stats285 Hackathon -- Tukey Group

Repository contains data and code for the hackathon

The `Data` directory contains an example dataset for congressional records. The full data is available via a link sent by email. 

The `Code` directory contains two examples: 
- `example_HC_for_congressional_speeches_data.ipynb` 
- `example_HC_for_congressional_speeches_data_2.ipynb`

These are jupyter notebook to run with R. If you do not have Jupyter for R installed then you can copy the code and run via R console. 

The goal of these examples is to introduce the concept of detecting changes in word usage using higher criticism (HC). The first example counts words in speeches from the 114th congress (note the list of word to ignore). The second example counts only the 7 "most important words" from each speech obtained using [TF-IDF https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf]
